SETUP
-Create a class, say tab.cs 
-import IL_TabView like: this- using IL_TabView;
-do not extend this class with a monobehaviour instead extend with TabViewScroll like below:
	public class tab: TabviewScroll{
	 }
-if you want to use start and update functions here you can override the functions as bellow:
	public override IL_Update(){}
	public override IL_Start(){}
	//these functions will work like Update() and Start();

-rest of the functions that you use in monobehviour can be used as it is.

*WARNING: Do not define Start and Update Function in the child script. to use Update() and Start use the above methode.
